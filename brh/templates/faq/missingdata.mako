<h2>Dealing with missing data.</h2>
Most cameras don't add much data to pictures. When this page is completed, it will detail our strategy for dealing with missing data.
<p>
For now... the short version!

      <h4>Deals with photos lacking time or space data.</h4>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>
	A user selects a group of pictures and then types in a "place" in the annotatin toolkit. This is just a short nicknames attached to pictures. In this way, every group in Black Rock creates its own list of places tied to pictures.
      </li>
      <li>
	If any of the pictures that are bunched under the place have location data, we spread it between the pictures.
      </li>
      <li>
	If no location data can be gathered, the user may drop the place onto a map of the playa. This ties a coordinate to the place-name.
      </li>
      <li>
	Then, a clustering analysis is carried out over place names and pictures across all groups in Black Rock Hologram. By searching for picture location data or coordinate pins for similarly named places across the entire database, we attempt to infer placements as often.
